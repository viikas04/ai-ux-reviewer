# About Me

## Name

Vikas C Sidenur

## Summary

I am a full-stack developer with a strong interest in backend systems and AI-integrated applications.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and build a complete production-style application from scratch, including:

- Backend API development using Node.js and Express
- LLM integration using Groq (LLaMA 3.1)
- Structured JSON handling from AI responses
- MongoDB database design and persistence
- Web scraping using Cheerio
- Frontend development with React
- System health monitoring and status reporting

I focus on writing clean, structured code and building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and well-documented.

I am particularly interested in backend architecture, API design, and real-world AI application development.
